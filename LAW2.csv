Medical
36. A person who intends to remain in the United
Kingdom for more than 6 months should normally
be referred to the Medical Inspector for
examination. If he produces a medical certiﬁcate he
should be advised to hand it to the Medical
Inspector. Any person seeking entry who mentions
health or medical treatment as a reason for his visit,
or who appears not to be in good mental or physical
health, should also be referred to the Medical
Inspector; and the Immigration Ofﬁcer has
discretion, which should be exercised sparingly, to
refer for examination in any other case.
37. Where the Medical Inspector advises that a
person seeking entry is suffering from a speciﬁed
disease or condition which may interfere with his
ability to support himself or his dependants, the
Immigration Ofﬁcer should take account of this, in
conjunction with other factors, in deciding whether
to admit that person. The Immigration Ofﬁcer
should also take account of the Medical Inspector’s
assessment of the likely course of treatment in
deciding whether a person seeking entry for private
medical treatment has sufﬁcient means at his
disposal.
38. A returning resident should not be refused leave
to enter or have existing leave to enter or remain
cancelled on medical grounds. But where a person
would be refused leave to enter or have existing
leave to enter or remain cancelled on medical
grounds if he were not a returning resident or in any
case where it is decided on compassionate grounds
not to exercise the power to refuse leave to enter or
to cancel existing leave to enter or remain, or in any
other case where the Medical Inspector so
recommends, the Immigration Ofﬁcer should give
the person concerned a notice requiring him to

Medical
36. A person who intends to remain in the United
Kingdom for more than 6 months should normally
be referred to the Medical Inspector for
examination. If he produces a medical certiﬁcate he
should be advised to hand it to the Medical
Inspector. Any person seeking entry who mentions
health or medical treatment as a reason for his visit,
or who appears not to be in good mental or physical
health, should also be referred to the Medical
Inspector; and the Immigration Ofﬁcer has
discretion, which should be exercised sparingly, to
refer for examination in any other case.
37. Where the Medical Inspector advises that a
person seeking entry is suffering from a speciﬁed
disease or condition which may interfere with his
ability to support himself or his dependants, the
Immigration Ofﬁcer should take account of this, in
conjunction with other factors, in deciding whether
to admit that person. The Immigration Ofﬁcer
should also take account of the Medical Inspector’s
assessment of the likely course of treatment in
deciding whether a person seeking entry for private
medical treatment has sufﬁcient means at his
disposal.
38. A returning resident should not be refused leave
to enter or have existing leave to enter or remain
cancelled on medical grounds. But where a person
would be refused leave to enter or have existing
leave to enter or remain cancelled on medical
grounds if he were not a returning resident or in any
case where it is decided on compassionate grounds
not to exercise the power to refuse leave to enter or
to cancel existing leave to enter or remain, or in any
other case where the Medical Inspector so
recommends, the Immigration Ofﬁcer should give
the person concerned a notice requiring him to

person seeking entry is suffering from a speciﬁed
disease or condition which may interfere with his
ability to support himself or his dependants, the
Immigration Ofﬁcer should take account of this, in
conjunction with other factors, in deciding whether
to admit that person. The Immigration Ofﬁcer
should also take account of the Medical Inspector’s
assessment of the likely course of treatment in
deciding whether a person seeking entry for private
medical treatment has sufﬁcient means at his
disposal.

person seeking entry is suffering from a speciﬁed
disease or condition which may interfere with his
ability to support himself or his dependants, the

conjunction with other factors, in deciding whether
to admit that person. The Immigration Ofﬁcer

assessment of the likely course of treatment in
deciding whether a person seeking entry for private
medical treatment has sufﬁcient means at his
disposal.

other case where the Medical Inspector so
recommends, the Immigration Ofﬁcer should give
